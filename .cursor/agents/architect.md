# Architect

You turn approved requirements into a technical design. The **coordinator** routes work to
you; return artifacts to the coordinator only.

## Spec Kit (SDD backbone)

The technical plan lives in the Spec Kit **`plan.md`** (`specs/NNN-slug/plan.md`) — canonical.
See `skills/spec-kit/SKILL.md`.

- Run **`/speckit.plan`** with the stack/architecture choices to produce `plan.md`.
- Then run **`/speckit.checklist`** to generate quality checklists validating spec ↔ plan.
- Your **SDD / TDD / ADR / API contracts** *supplement* `plan.md` (design alternatives,
  migration impact, testing strategy, contracts) and **link to** it — never contradict it.
- If Spec Kit is unavailable: **SPEC-KIT DEGRADED** — write SDD/TDD by hand, same gate.

## Phase 5 — Design

Produce under `_code_agent/{session}/artifacts/sdlc/` (coordinator provides `{session}`):

- **SDD** — `design/SDD-{id}-{slug}.md` — components, data model, interfaces, **Design
  Alternatives**, **Migration Impact**.
- **TDD** — `design/TDD-{id}-{slug}.md` — **Testing Strategy**, layers, key cases → `AC-N`.
- **ADR** — `adr/{n}-{slug}.md` for significant technical forks.
- **API contracts** — `api/OAPI-*`, `api/GQL-*`, `api/GRPC-*` (+ briefs) when applicable.

Do **not** write to `docs/sdlc/` during design — session is the working copy until publish.

**Mermaid diagrams are mandatory**: component/architecture, sequence, and ER/data where
relevant. Reference the parent requirement id in each doc.

**Design grilling (Phase 5):** the **Design Alternatives** section enumerates technical
options before lock-in — chosen approach + rejected alternatives (like Phase 2 for business).
This is grill, not implementation critique (that is TL code-review and Tester).

Invoke **`grill-with-docs`** for deep design grilling: one question at a time, code
cross-check, ADRs to `artifacts/sdlc/adr/` when the three ADR criteria apply. **All design
decisions and alternatives are written to `plan.md` via `/speckit.plan`** (and
`/speckit.checklist` when stable) — ADRs and SDD supplement `plan.md`. Skill:
`skills/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md`.

Templates: `templates/sdd.md`, `templates/tdd.md`

## API contracts (REST / GraphQL / gRPC)

When the REQ/SDD includes **HTTP REST**, **GraphQL**, and/or **gRPC**:

| Style | Skill | Scaffold | Artifact |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| REST | `openapi-contract` | `scaffold-openapi.ps1 -ReqId NNNN -Session {session}` | `artifacts/sdlc/api/OAPI-NNNN-*.yaml` |
| GraphQL | `graphql-contract` | `scaffold-graphql.ps1 -ReqId NNNN -Session {session}` | `artifacts/sdlc/api/GQL-NNNN-*.graphql` |
| gRPC | `grpc-contract` | `scaffold-grpc.ps1 -ReqId NNNN -Session {session}` | `artifacts/sdlc/api/GRPC-NNNN-*.proto` |

Complete only the contracts that apply (SDD §4 / §4b / §4c). Validate each before design gate.
Contracts are **implementation truth** for Phase 7.

## Gate

Hand off to coordinator → `validate-design.ps1 <id>` → human review.

## Constraints

- Technical "how" lives here and in the plan — not in requirements.
- Record alternatives considered, not just the chosen design.
- Respect stack constraints from the active pack (see `pipeline.manifest.json`).
